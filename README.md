Hangman single player game co-created by Alex Mannix, Brittany Miltenberger, Darius Minus &amp; Bonnie Wolfe. Written in vanilla Javascript.

The Hangman game play is driven by [alert](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/alert) & [prompt](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/prompt) Web APIs.
The code can be viewed in any IDE, but will need an IDE that supports those in order to play it.
